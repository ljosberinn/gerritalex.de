An overview of which abilities get mitigated by <WowheadLink kind="spell" id={374227} icon="ability_evoker_hoverblack">Zephyr</WowheadLink>, and thus avoidance aswell.

For dungeons, consult [Not Even Close](https://not-even-close.com/) for what's actually deadly.

**Does not include entirely avoidable damage such as standing in what's commonly referred as swirlies**.
