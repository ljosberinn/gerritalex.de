We've now had a couple days to have a first look at the Midnight Alpha and I want to summarize a couple of my thoughts, but also document an initial impression as well as issues and possible solutions.

I will also be updating this post throughout Alpha and Beta cycles, but to give myself the change to test changes and gather a deeper impression, it'll always be delayed a bit, just like this one.

## Initial Alpha Launch

Oct 1st 2025, [Source](https://www.wowhead.com/news/midnight-alpha-development-notes-378688)

> - *Developer's notes: The goal of these changes is to simplify <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> targeting in raid environments. Since it now applies to all members of the raid, there is no need to micromanage who it should go on. There will still be some buff management gameplay with <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink>, which will continue to have a smart-targeting option for those who do not want to swap targets between enemies and allies frequently. Overall this should make raid gameplay much smoother and similar to dungeon gameplay.*

### Thoughts

#### Raid Changes

Let's talk about <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> becoming raid-wide first:

Contrary to popular belief, for all of War Within already it wasn't needed to min-max buff targeting to perform well outside of maybe the RWF or a similar world rank. There's still a burden of preparation on the player, needing to know encounter timings and which spec/which player in your raid is the best to buff for the given scenario, but that's trivial, especially for farm. That burden will also continue to exist, as you'll now want to target the best players with <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink> instead. Some encounters like Nexus-King or Dimensius make it also very easy to swap buff targets situationally.

It's worth noting that while 100 yards **application** range is great and technically unchanged, the current **extension** range is only ~45 yards and leads to awkwardness in too many scenarios. We still have to re-test whether this also got adjusted.

Previously, <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink> was the targeting mechanism for <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink>, which then was the indicator for which players <WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink> should go on. Now with <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> on everyone, <WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink> would just apply to the closest <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink>-buffed player unless targeting gets updated. It's of course a question of whether this is now considered unwanted, but <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink> becoming the driver for <WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink> targeting would be a reasonable adjustment.

#### Apex Talent

Not extremely fond of introducing more pets with possibly wonky targeting or pathing. For context, the current <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> set summons a <WowheadLink id={219827} kind="npc">Dracthyr Commando</WowheadLink> which will <WowheadLink id={1236970} icon="ability_evoker_pyre" kind="spell">Pyre</WowheadLink> while flying and then continue to <WowheadLink id={1236949} icon="ability_evoker_disintegrate" kind="spell">Disintegrate</WowheadLink> for a bit. Unforunately however, they don't choose your target so they'll happily slap some irrelevant minion next to your own target half of the time.

The non-pet elements are intriguing however:
- doubling the effects of <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> for a minimum of - currently - 20 seconds sounds very strong for keys in particular as <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> - again currently - is available for every pull as <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon>
- the extension isn't particularily exciting but just happens naturally anyway so why not

Ultimately not extremely surprising for Blizzard to introduce yet another source of personal damage. First impression is also that it seems to favor <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> rather significantly over Chronowarden for a variety of reasons:
- <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> simply has more <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> available, so more <WowheadLink branch="beta" icon="ability_evoker_recall" id={1259173} kind="spell">Duplicate</WowheadLink>s
- <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> is also more likely to play <WowheadLink id={396286} icon="ability_evoker_upheaval" kind="spell">Upheaval</WowheadLink>-empowering talents to begin with, or at least has been historically
- the only blatantly obvious synergy with <WowheadSpecIcon spec="chronowarden">Chronowarden</WowheadSpecIcon> is <WowheadLink id={431874} icon="spell_holy_borrowedtime" kind="spell">Double-time</WowheadLink> getting gigabuffed during <WowheadLink branch="beta" icon="ability_evoker_recall" id={1259173} kind="spell">Duplicate</WowheadLink>

Rotational implication is minimal. Before you wanted to <WowheadLink id={357208} icon="ability_evoker_firebreath" kind="spell">Fire Breath</WowheadLink> ahead of <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink>, now you'll want to do it after, unfortunately counteracting <WowheadLink icon="spell_burningbladeshaman_blazing_radiance" id={459537} kind="spell">Imminent Destruction</WowheadLink>.

#### Talent Changes

- new talent: <WowheadLink branch="beta" icon="ability_evoker_masterylifebinder_bronze" id={1250914} kind="spell">Clairvoyant</WowheadLink>
  - more power to <WowheadLink id={409267} icon="ability_evoker_motesofpossibility" kind="spell">Motes of Possibility</WowheadLink> - I'm ok with that. Currently you have a 33% chance to roll an entirely irrelevant buff - <WowheadLink id={410685} icon="inv_10_herb_seed_magiccolor5" kind="spell">Symbiotic Bloom</WowheadLink> - that doesn't even reattribute in logs, now it'll be 25%.
- changed: <WowheadLink id={406907} icon="inv_tradeskill_skinning_prismaticscale" kind="spell">Regenerative Chitin</WowheadLink>
  - good quality of life change, paired with an undocumented change to <WowheadLink id={360827} icon="ability_evoker_blisteringscales" kind="spell">Blistering Scales</WowheadLink> in general: it now lasts 60 minutes baseline!
  - <WowheadLink id={360827} icon="ability_evoker_blisteringscales" kind="spell">Blistering Scales</WowheadLink> damage was painfully low, so 20% more won't fix anything but also certainly doesn't hurt
- changed: <WowheadLink id={404195} icon="ability_evoker_defyfate" kind="spell">Defy Fate</WowheadLink> healing
  - irrelevant, doesn't hurt
- changed: <WowheadLink id={410643} icon="spell_shaman_spewlava" kind="spell">Molten Blood</WowheadLink> absorb
  - irrelevant, still dead
  - absorbs 2100/54860 when at max health (3.8%)
  - absorbs 5249/54860 when at ~10% health (9.5%)
- changed: <WowheadLink id={410261} icon="ability_evoker_infernosblessing" kind="spell">Inferno's Blessing</WowheadLink>
  - it seems to now do approximately 75% of an <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink>
  - welcome change, as it did terribly low damage before in AoE
  - since it can also be rolled from <WowheadLink id={409267} icon="ability_evoker_motesofpossibility" kind="spell">Motes of Possibility</WowheadLink>, we'll take those
- changed: <WowheadLink id={408775} icon="spell_fire_immolation" kind="spell">Ignition Rush</WowheadLink>
  - position change is nice
  - damage increase to <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink> slowly starts to read like some of those Mistweaver Renewing Mists mods (15% here, 20% there, 25% over there) but <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink> is our bread and butter still so I'll take it
- removed: <WowheadLink id={1219236} icon="ability_evoker_earthensky" kind="spell">Rockfall</WowheadLink>
  - entirely ok with this. annoying RNG talent

#### New Hero Talents

##### <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon>

- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1260745} icon="ability_dragonriding_dynamicflight01" kind="spell">Command Squadron</WowheadLink>
  > While flying during <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> you are assisted by a squadron of Dracthyr who assault enemies with Pyre, dealing (365% of Spell Power) Fire damage to nearby enemies up to 8 times.
  - basically half of the 11.2 set with minor QoL improvements:
  - the squad now fires at your target before you hit something with <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> if you don't hit something with <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> within the first ~1.5 seconds. If you have none, they'll pick a close by target.
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1261448} icon="inv_10_dungeonjewelry_dragon_trinket_1arcanemagical_blue" kind="spell">Concentrated Power</WowheadLink>
  > <WowheadLink id={438587} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Mass Eruption</WowheadLink> strikes 1 additional target.
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1261452} icon="ability_evoker_essenceburststacks" kind="spell">Refined Essence</WowheadLink>
  > Essence abilities deal 15% additional damage.
  - effectively just another <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink> amp, we stack plenty of those already but its on theme for <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> and continues the trend of increasing personal damage done


##### <WowheadSpecIcon spec="chronowarden">Chronowarden</WowheadSpecIcon>
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1260484} icon="ability_evoker_tipthescales" kind="spell">Chronoboon</WowheadLink>
  > <WowheadLink id={370553} icon="ability_evoker_tipthescales" kind="spell">Tip the Scales</WowheadLink>' cooldown is reduced by 30 sec.
  - also basically half of the 11.2 set, except halfed in power
  - confusing, because you'd always want to sync it with <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> but due to this talent, its now guaranteed to be ready ~15s ahead of each Breath and you end up holding it for Breath anyway
  - so.. what's the point of this talent then?
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1260568} icon="ability_evoker_innatemagic4" kind="spell">Energy Cycles</WowheadLink>
  > <WowheadLink id={431695} icon="ability_evoker_essenceburst5" kind="spell">Temporal Burst</WowheadLink> grants <WowheadLink id={392268} icon="ability_evoker_essenceburst" kind="spell">Essence Burst</WowheadLink> every 6 sec.
  - kind of a throwback to the <WowheadLink id={422871} icon="inv_legion_faction_dreamweavers" kind="spell">Evoker Devastation 10.2 Class Set 4pc</WowheadLink> (do not mention this to <WowheadSpecIcon spec="devastation-evoker">Devastation Evokers</WowheadSpecIcon>, that set is not remembered fondly)
  - _probably_ ok for Aug to have just due to how little <WowheadLink id={392268} icon="ability_evoker_essenceburst" kind="spell">Essence Burst</WowheadLink> it can reliably generate
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1260647} icon="spell_holy_borrowedtime" kind="spell">Overclock</WowheadLink>
  > <WowheadLink id={431442} icon="inv_ability_chronowardenevoker_chronoflame" kind="spell">Chrono Flames</WowheadLink>' maximum damage or healing is increased by 40%, up to [(Spell Power * 3.5) * (1 + Versatility)] Arcane.

#### Tuning
> <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> now grants 8% primary stat (was 5%)

> <WowheadLink id={403631} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink> accumulates 15% of damage (was 10%)

Straight forward W from a current point of view. Sims will tell more once we're there.

Do note that this is paired with an undocumented removal of <WowheadLink id={396043} icon="ability_dragonriding_yearningforthesky01" kind="spell">Close as Clutchmates</WowheadLink>.

> <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> now splits its effect when applies to more than 2 other allies (...)

This is a very welcome change and something I've been advocating for for a while. We'll circle back to that under Problems in just a minute however.

> (...) and is no longer is limited to 2 maximum applications.

Time will tell whether this can become problematic.

### Problems

Some old, some new.

> <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> now splits its effect when applies to more than 2 other allies (...)

We're almost there. This needs the following tweaks:
- (again, currently not re-tested) the extension range on Live is only 45 yards - please raise this to 100 yards. Why is it even ~45 to begin with?
- name it increase its value if less than 2 targets are affected
- make it re-evaluate its state once a buffed player dies or the aura expires on them due to outranging, e.g. on Fractillus you can currently be buffing players that spread to the far side, losing extensions

This is a **major** pain point for Augmentation in keys in particular since 11.2 now since you only buff the other two DPS: the moment a buffed dps dies, you lose a considerable amount of both of your buff _and_ personal damage:
- if a combat ressurection is available, you situationally want to avoid casting any extender now in anticipation of the resurrection, which leads to you losing <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> early
  - you're thus forced to spam <WowheadLink icon="ability_evoker_livingflame" id={361469} kind="spell">Living Flame</WowheadLink>, but now that you don't even have the +20% self-buff from <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> anymore
- if no combat resurrection is available, well, unluck I guess. You're locked out of most of your damage buff now because.  

No spec gets punished for another party member dying. Why does Aug get punished twice?

> more personal damage through the introduction of <WowheadLink branch="beta" icon="ability_evoker_recall" id={1259173} kind="spell">Duplicate</WowheadLink>

More and more personal damage means less and less reason to buff others. More buff damage offsets this and that has already happened here.

However, <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink> and <WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink> will still be significantly more impactful on the Augmentation player themselves over the tank or healer. It's time to update the smart-targeting logic.

> <WowheadLink branch="beta" icon="ability_evoker_recall" id={1259173} kind="spell">Duplicate</WowheadLink> pet targeting

Initial testing suggests it's already behaving like that but time will tell whether that reliably checks out - but please, make it target our current target.

> Weird Talent Pathing

Neither <WowheadLink id={410352} icon="ability_evoker_timedilation" kind="spell">Stretch Time</WowheadLink> nor <WowheadLink id={412710} icon="ability_evoker_timelessness" kind="spell">Timelessness</WowheadLink> have any logical connection to <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink>. Neither are attractive for raid or the far majority of dungeon content.

### Suggestions
- consider making <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink> the targeting driver for <WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink>
- increase extension range of <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> to 100 yards too
- make <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> re-evaluate its state once a second/on extensions
  - and/or whenever someone dies or outranges it
- increase the effect of <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> in dungeons if less than 2 targets are buffed to avoid punishing the surviving dps
- make it re-evaluate its splitting state once a buffed player dies or the aura expires on them due to outranging
- move the +20% self-buff from <WowheadLink id={395152} icon="spell_sarkareth" kind="spell">Ebon Might</WowheadLink> to the general spec aura
  - this doesn't suddenly enable casting extenders outside of EM, but at least active dots and <WowheadLink icon="ability_evoker_livingflame" id={361469} kind="spell">Living Flame</WowheadLink> won't be wet noodles
- update <WowheadLink id={409311} icon="ability_evoker_prescience" kind="spell">Prescience</WowheadLink>/<WowheadLink id={413984} icon="ability_evoker_masterytimewalker" kind="spell">Shifting Sands</WowheadLink> smart-targeting logic to the following:
  - other DPS by proximity unless already buffed
  - self unless buffed
  - tank/heal by proximity
- swap <WowheadLink id={454983} icon="classicon_evoker" kind="spell"> Arcane Reach</WowheadLink> with <WowheadLink id={410352} icon="ability_evoker_timedilation" kind="spell">Stretch Time</WowheadLink>
- make <WowheadLink id={407243} icon="ability_evoker_aspectsfavor" kind="spell">Aspect's Favor</WowheadLink> a one-pointer
  - it'll find a niche by that, but due to its problematic past, imo just replace it
- make <WowheadLink id={410685} icon="inv_10_herb_seed_magiccolor5" kind="spell">Symbiotic Bloom</WowheadLink> reattribute in logs at least
- remove <WowheadLink id={410687} icon="ability_evoker_reversion_green" kind="spell">Prolong Life</WowheadLink> / <WowheadLink id={414969} icon="ability_evoker_masterylifebinder" kind="spell">Dream of Spring</WowheadLink> or at a minimum, change them to something interesting

### Bugs

Of course there's a bunch of bugs, entirely expected at this point, so I'll just dump the list:

#### General
- <WowheadLink branch="beta" id={1260745} icon="ability_dragonriding_dynamicflight01" kind="spell">Command Squadron</WowheadLink> does not work when talented out of <WowheadLink id={433871} icon="ability_evoker_deepbreath" kind="spell">Maneuverability</WowheadLink>

  - <WowheadLink id={360827} icon="ability_evoker_blisteringscales" kind="spell">Blistering Scales</WowheadLink> was updated to last for 60 minutes in 12.0
