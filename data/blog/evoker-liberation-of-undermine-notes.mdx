My personal encounter notes. Some of this is generic in regards to e.g. intermission timers and cooldown decisions so others may also find it helpful.

## Vexie and the Geargrinders

- <RenewingBlaze /> on cd
- <Zephyr /> has most value during the intermission but by far doesn't cover it
- nothing specific for <ObsidianScales />

### Devastation

- <Dragonrage /> on pull
- 2nd <Dragonrage /> on intermission (~2:00 to 2:10)
- 3rd <Dragonrage /> hold until intermission (~4:30 to 5:00)
- 4th <Dragonrage /> hold until intermission (~7:10)

### Augmentation

- <BreathOfEons/> on pull
- hold 2nd <BreathOfEons/> for intermission (~2:00)
- hold 3rd <BreathOfEons/> for intermission (~4:30)
- hold 3rd <BreathOfEons/> for intermission (~7:10)
- due to holding cds and variable phasing time, this might be a Chronowarden angle. the intermission lasts usually longer than 40s

#### Scalecommander
- spreading <Bombardments /> on the bikers isn't worth, they shouldn't live that long
- spreading <Bombardments /> during the intermission may be worth, will have to see

#### Chronowarden

- make sure you have empowers for <BreathOfEons />

## Cauldron of Carnage

- intermissions are
  - 1:15
  - 2:50
- on <Torq/> side, <RenewingBlaze /> on cd due to <GalvanizedSpite /> and <StaticCharge />
- on <Flarendo /> side, hold <RenewingBlaze /> for <MoltenPhlegm />
- <Zephyr /> has most value during intermissions
  - can alternatively be used to mitigate <MoltenPhlegm /> or <Scrapbomb />
- <ObsidianScales /> <Scrapbomb />

### Devastation

- no specific cd windows due to intermissions, full send

#### Scalecommander

- save empowers briefly before intermission to <MassDisintegrate /> both bosses

### Augmentation

- probably also just full send

#### Scalecommander

- 2nd <BreathOfEons/> is during intermission but it's probably sketchy to execute on prog without wall
- spread <Bombardments /> during intermission for extra cdr

## Rik Reverb

- <Pyrotechnics /> spawn 3x per main phase
  - first set
    - 0:22
    - 1:05 (+43)
    - 1:46 (+41)
  - second set
    - 2:51
    - 3:35 (+43)
    - 4:16 (+41)
  - third set
    - 5:19
    - 6:02 (+43)
    - 6:44 (+41)
- intermissions from
  - 2:00 to 2:30
  - 4:30 to 5:00

- can wall <StaticJolt />? there's not much going on individual damage wise and these are the largest hits unless <Pyrotechnics /> explode
- <Zephyr /> also kinda yolo for <StaticJolt />

### Devastation

- precast <DeepBreath /> on the adds 
- <Dragonrage /> every first set of adds on pull/after intermission

### Augmentation

- if boss is tanked on top of the bulk of the sets, can probably hold <BreathOfEons /> for that, otherwise send on pull and on cd
