## Mahatma Ghandi on God

I do dimly perceive that whilst everything around me is ever changing, ever dying, there is underlying all that change a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and recreates.

That informing power of spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is. And is this power benevolent or malevolent? I see it as purely benevolent, for I can see that in the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists. Hence I gather that God is life, truth, light. He is love. He is the supreme Good.

But He is no God who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does. God, to be God, must rule the heart and transform it. He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary. This can only be done through a definite realization, more real than the five senses can ever produce.

Sense perceptions can be and often are false and deceptive, however real they may appear to us. Where there is realization outside the senses, it is infallible. It is proved not by extraneous evidence but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.

Such testimony is to be found in the experiences of an unbroken line of prophets and sages in all countries and climes. To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.

This realization is preceded by an immovable faith. He who would in his own person test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in the moral government of the world and therefore in the supremacy of the moral law, the law of truth and love.

Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to truth and love.

I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason. Faith transcends reason. All that I can advise is not to attempt the impossible.

## Excerpt of Funkadelic - Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts

You gravitate to that which you secretly love most<br />
You meet in life the exact reproduction of your own thoughts<br />
There is no chance, coincidence or accident<br />
In a world ruled by law and divine order<br />
You rise as high as your dominant aspiration<br />
You descend to the level of your lowest concept of your self<br />
Free your mind and your ass will follow

The infinite intelligence within you knows the answers<br />
Its nature is to respond to your thoughts<br />
Be careful of the thought-seeds you plant in the garden of your mind<br />
For seeds grow after their kind

(...)

Every thought felt as true<br />
Or allowed to be accepted as true by your conscious mind<br />
Take roots in your subconscious Blossoms sooner or later into an act And bears its own fruit Good<br />
thoughts bring forth good fruit Bullshit thoughts rot your meat Think right, and you can fly The<br />
kingdom of heaven is within Free your mind, and your ass will follow
