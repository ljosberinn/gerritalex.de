_This will get expanded weekly whenever more dungeons get tested and enough data is available!_

An overview of which abilities get mitigated by <WowheadLink kind="spell" id={374227} icon="ability_evoker_hoverblack">Zephyr</WowheadLink>, and thus avoidance aswell.

For dungeons, consult [Not Even Close](https://not-even-close.com/) for what's actually deadly.

**Does not include very obvious avoidable damage such as standing in swirlies or frontals**.
