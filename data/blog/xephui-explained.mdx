## XephUI?

## Core Philosophy

### Colocation

If you're a developer you might've heard that one before: the concept of keeping things together that belong together.

For the larger part, I've found that all spec buffs & abilities can be categorized into the following groups:

#### Buffs You Actually Care About

You'll always find these in the _top left_ of whatever resource bars the aura pack has.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={459574} icon="spell_burningbladeshaman_blazing_radiance" kind="spell">Imminent Destruction</WowheadLink>

    <WowheadLink id={459574} icon="spell_burningbladeshaman_blazing_radiance" kind="spell">Imminent Destruction</WowheadLink> is an <WowheadSpecIcon spec="augmentation-evoker">Augmentation Evoker</WowheadSpecIcon> talent which reduces resource cost of their only spender <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink> and casting lots of <WowheadLink id={395160} icon="ability_evoker_eruption" kind="spell">Eruption</WowheadLink>s during that window is one of the keys to perform well. 

- _Example_: any kind of defensives

    Crucial to know how long you're safe. Self-explaining.

#### Maintenance Abilities & Auras

You'll always find these in the _top right_ of whatever resource bars the aura pack has.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={359077} icon="ability_evoker_eternitysurge" kind="spell">Eternity Surge</WowheadLink>

    For <WowheadSpecIcon spec="devastation-evoker">Devastation Evoker</WowheadSpecIcon>s, empower spells are largely [fire-and-forget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-and-forget) abilities: you only care about their cooldown briefly before it's ready and when it's ready. Hiding these while on cooldown comes at no cost.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={368432} icon="ability_evoker_unravel" kind="spell">Unravel</WowheadLink>

    Very high priority button to use when you actually can.

    Unfortunately the spell is bugged since its introduction and lights up in the default UI when it shouldn't. My aura fixes that and will only show up when you can actually use it.

    Hiding it entirely when you cannot - which is the far majority of time as there are only few relevant shields - is a no brainer.

#### Major Cooldowns & Defensives

This is the first ability row, always below whatever resource bars the aura pack has.

It begins with your major and minor cooldowns and always ends with usable trinkets.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={442204} icon="ability_evoker_breathofeons" kind="spell">Breath of Eons</WowheadLink>

    Major cooldown of <WowheadSpecIcon spec="augmentation-evoker">Augmentation Evoker</WowheadSpecIcon>. Obviously you want to see when it's ready, so putting it in a prominent position is reasonable.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={363916} icon="inv_artifact_dragonscales" kind="spell">Obsidian Scales</WowheadLink>

    Primary defensive of Evokers.

#### Interrupt & Utility

This is the second ability row, always below the first.

It commonly begins with your interrupt and then your remaining utility kit by order of importance, always ending with racials.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={351338} icon="ability_evoker_quell" kind="spell">Quell</WowheadLink>

    Most specs begin this row with their interrupt - having it in a prominent position primes you for lots of interrupts. At least so the thought.

    However, specs with spammable rotational buttons like <WowheadSpecIcon spec="vengeance-demon-hunter">Vengeance Demon Hunter</WowheadSpecIcon>s start with that button instead, i.e. <WowheadLink id={263642} icon="ability_creature_felsunder" kind="spell">Fracture</WowheadLink>.

    The idea is very similar: you want to press that button a lot. It also tracks the global cooldown and your interrupt is right next to it, in easy reach.

- _Example_: <WowheadLink id={374251} icon="ability_evoker_fontofmagic_red" kind="spell">Cauterizing Flame</WowheadLink>

    Extremely powerful button, but equally situational. Important to track. Not so important to be in a prominent position however.

### Don't Track Impactless Things

You'll often see in aura packs that they track every single proc/buff and/or at stacks that don't matter (yet). This is one of the reasons why I started building my own auras in the beginning.

**Less ends up being more.** Having less distracting icons on your screen is a good thing. If a buff doesn't alter your decision making in the slightest, there's no need to track it, outside of curiousity.

And as a log person, that kind of curiousity can be satisfied by looking at logs to determine uptime etc. which is generally advisable anyway as - in most cases - this gives you an objective number you can put your finger on rather than "oh this procced a lot during 2 min target dummy testing, it must be good!".

Things you don't care about? The list is long.

- <WowheadLink id={441248} icon="ability_siege_engineer_superheated" kind="spell">Unrelenting Siege</WowheadLink> is a <WowheadSpecIcon spec="scalecommander">Scalecommander</WowheadSpecIcon> talent which ramps upon entering combat over 15 seconds and then just is a permanent buff until leaving combat. It's a flat damage increase for the affected abilities. It doesn't change your rotation, you never hold anything until max amount of stacks, you can't play around it between pulls as it just entirely drops.

- <WowheadLink id={406043} icon="ability_evoker_nourishingsands" kind="spell">Nourishing Sands</WowheadLink> is an <WowheadSpecIcon spec="augmentation-evoker">Augmentation Evoker</WowheadSpecIcon> talent granting a 20% healing bonus to <WowheadLink id={355913} icon="ability_evoker_emeraldblossom" kind="spell">Emerald Blossom</WowheadLink> if you deal the killing blow to an enemy. Unfortunately, <WowheadLink id={355913} icon="ability_evoker_emeraldblossom" kind="spell">Emerald Blossom</WowheadLink>s healing is terribly low and only ever worth pressing at the end of a pull in dungeons, never in raid unless you're waiting or for self-heal purposes when questing or similar. But then I'm asking: why are you currently Augmentation?

This also goes hand in hand with...

### Quality Over Quantity

Every other week I get asked to support spec x and while I'd love to, I don't know enough about many specs to create a full pack for it, even if I already support another spec of the same class.

Additionally, the maintenance burden increases. Per spec I'm already devoting a minimum of an hour every PTR cycle to ensure everything continues to work and adjust where needed.

However, it also means that what I support adheres to the quality expectations I have for myself:

- [x] high performance
  - I continuously profile my auras in both raid and keys to ensure their footprint is as minimal as possible
  - everything has fine-grained load conditions
- [x] updated ahead of time (i.e. PTR/Beta)
  - not only do I monitor patch notes for all supported specs continuously, I also commit myself to update all specs before the next content launches, with compatibility layers where needed
- [x] battle-tested
  - while I obviously don't play all the specs myself, there's only features in all packs that I know are reliably working on the specs I personally play
    - for example, the focus cast bar was tested exhaustively before on my main spec before it made its way into other packs
- [x] somewhat peer-reviewed
  - I talk to high level players and/or guide writers/theorycrafters about the specs I'm working on, compare against logs and data-aggregation sites like Archon

## Sounds

The most controversial feature is and remains the sounds and understandably so.

### Why Sounds?

Sounds play a significant role in human memory. People connect certain sounds to certain things and this will behave just like that. 

Once you've learned what each sound means, you'll not only be able to react faster to the situation - and more importantly, without having to look at buttons - but also be able to pick up other specs XephUI supports significantly faster as sounds are streamlined.

### Problems

While you can select sounds channels on a per-sound basis in WeakAuras, people have sound channels at different volume levels. There's no specific sound channel only for addons and you cannot set volume for individual auras.

Auto-cloned auras with sound triggers are... special. You'll hear the sound for each time an aura is cloned - on group-wide debuffs for <WowheadLink id={365585} icon="ability_evoker_fontofmagic_green" kind="spell">Expunge</WowheadLink> for example it's no rarity to have 5x the sound playing. This could be solved with custom code but I'm not convinced that's the right approach.

Having unique sounds would be handy - I'm limiting myself to what WeakAuras ships with out of the box. Adding more would require downloading a separate addon shipping those on top which is the sole reason I haven't done that.

| Other Dispel [if you can]                                                                         | Temple Bell          |
| Kaching                                                                                           | Special Proc         |

## Maintenance

What changes every patch?

TLDR: as little as possible.
