## Introduction & History

Back in Shadowlands Season 3 when I was still tanking, I first installed [Aeneas Plater](https://wago.io/TgqTbkIKa) profile and it was night and day. By modern standards, the profile didn't include much. Establishing a consistent nameplate color language was such a massive quality of life improvement however that I never considered going back. And why would anyone?

Aeneas quit at some point in Dragonflight, or at least stopped maintaining their profile, so I forked it and [started maintaining my own](https://wago.io/vHtguW84j). Eventually Jundies - [who also forked Aeneas](https://wago.io/ak3iS95aa) - and I [joined forces ahead of The War Within](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveWoW/comments/1e9da7y/jundies_plater_large_updates_for_the_war_within/) and we ended up seeing massive growth. In fact, there's a good chance you're here because you're using it. If not, you've likely seen it on streams, or know guildies using it. Frankly, a success far beyond what we anticipated.

And now, we're here to talk about the upcoming changes to nameplates in Midnight from various perspectives:
- Jundies raids as melee in [\<poptart cornDog\> (US)](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/guild/us/tichondrius/poptart%20corndog), around world rank 20
- [Xephyris](https://raider.io/characters/eu/blackrock/Xephyris) (me) raids as DPS Evoker main in [\<Mental Apocalypse\> (EU)](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/guild/eu/ragnaros/mental%20apocalypse), around world rank 100
- I'm also always pushing keys considerably deep into title, initially as tank, having achieved 6 seasonal titles so far
- I've been modernizing all mods and scripts in the profile to be both as efficient as possible, reducing the performance footprint of the profile by over 70% while adding more features so I'm considerably familiar with what's currently possible

This isn't to boast, but more to establish a baseline of knowledge about us who meticulously maintain(ed) this profile for more or less two expansions now. Keeping this up to date - we provided near-exhaustive updates late into PTR/ahead of patch release - understanding when to use which tool, keeping track of all the special cases is a lot of work that requires understanding the circumstances at a high level.

## Feature Parity

Let's get this out of the way. We cannot and should not expect feature parity. Blizzards outspoken goal here is to **reduce the necessity** of some of what addons are capable of, so we should expect to see the need for some of this to also vanish. In either case, there will be growing pains, that's guaranteed.

I'm already apologizing for this post to have become this large, but there is a lot to unravel. You'll forgive me for some of the yap too, I hope everyone can agree that we're all very passionate about these things in one way or another and there's only so many chances on actually talking this through. I'm also "afraid" that I'm basically celebrating having to sunset (only) two years of work here and appreciate there's addon developers out there having done this for literally 10x the time.

Thanks to the bunch of folks I sent excerpts for early feedback, thanks to Continuity for answering my questions.

### Nameplate (Re)Positioning Behaviour

How nameplates arrange themselves is not something we have a lot of control over and we shouldn't either. Logic for this has always been handled by Blizzard, what we could is simply choosing generally between `Stacking` and `Overlapping` nameplates between which as far as I'm aware, `Stacking` has been the default and clear winner:

- cvars todo

With Midnight, Blizzard is iterating on their behaviour:

> Developers' notes: Behavior of stacking nameplates is still a work in progress.
- [Alpha Development Notes Week 1](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/midnight-alpha-test-development-notes/590289)

> Nameplate stacking behavior has been adjusted to no longer overlap with nameplates in other groupings and are less likely to clump at the top of the screen.
  > Developer's notes: There may still be overall stickiness of the nameplates that is not behaving as desired. (...)
- [Alpha Development Notes Week 2](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/midnight-alpha-test-development-notes/590289)

Looking at this - for the most probably familiar - Azure Vault pull, we quickly discover why this is a problem and needs work. From other larger pulls like in Priory or Gambit in this season, you'll also be probably deeply familiar with nameplates at the top of the screen.

  </figure>
</center>

It's no surprise that with Plater enabled, the overall movement stays roughly the same. I'm not completely certain why the plates don't clump at the top, presumably because Plater sets a couple CVars on load or working around the actual dimensions of plates to try to keep them as close together as possible.

We can probably agree on that in both scenarios, nameplates don't move unreasonable amounts. It's possible to consistently target the correct NPC until you have really egregiously sized pulls. You can also pretty reliably tell where the actual NPC is currently located based on its nameplate.

Unfortunately we've not seen any progress being made on the following weird behaviour since its introduction week 1 and I initially had planned to omit it because I anticipated it'll get fixed asap, so here comes the current Alpha behaviour - brace yourselves.

### General Customization
#### Unit Name
The ability of customizing the unit name.

Before:

After:

#### Visual Customization

#### Health Formatting
The ability of changing how health values are displayed.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't show health values
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows showing numbers
  - basic options allow customizing them, including color and font
  - third party code can further fill the gap
After:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Midnight Nameplate Options allow showing both absolute and % values
- ‚ùå Plater is bound to the API restrictions: `UnitHealth`, `UnitHealthMax` as well as `UnitHealthPercent` return secrets

##### Verdict

Unfortunately health values use `AbbreviateLargeNumbers` internally, a function you may be familiar from formatting numbers in WeakAuras as it's one of the default options, which behaves in questionable ways, using only the next largest unit past five digits:

```lua
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(1024) -- yields 1,024 üéâ
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(10240) -- yields 10,240, should be 10.2 K
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(102400) -- yields 102 K üéâ
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(1024000) -- yields 1024 K, should be 1.02 M
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(10240000) -- yields 10240 K, should be 10.2 M
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(102400000) -- yields 102 M üéâ
AbbreviateLargeNumbers(1024000000) -- yields 1024 M, should be 1.02 B
```

After the squish, as of now, enemies will once again have above 50k health relatively soon and bosses will be in the tens of millions, meaning you'll more often than not see nameplates with numbers such as `52,349`, taking up unreasonably much space that currently we simply don't have. This makes it very impractical to use both absolute health and % values.

Additionally, percentages never show fractions.

##### Suggestion

Allow customizing both.

#### Target Highlighting
The ability to highlight the players current target in any form.

Before:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Retail Default Nameplates highlight the target slightly
  - if you don't always show names, it'll get shown for your current target
  - the border color changes from black to white
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting your target through various options
  - custom border color
  - custom scale
  - custom texture

After:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Midnight Nameplate Options allow highlighting the target by showing its name on the nameplate, depending on your settings
  - in addition, it will **always** upscale the nameplate by ~50%, putting major emphasis on it
  - the border color changes from black to white
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting your target through various options
  - custom border color
  - custom scale
  - custom texture

##### Verdict & Suggestion

Probably better to let a clip speak for itself.

<center>
    <video src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/targeting-behaviour.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls muted loop autoPlay />
</center>

At a minimum, make the scaling an option (read: a slider with e.g. 5% steps beginning at 0% increased scale to 50%). I appreciate it's with the best intent but this is not great. Forcing the nameplate into the center of the pack of nameplates you're looking at may be fine once you're used to it but introducing this without setting is questionable UX at best, pattern-breaking what's established for literal decades.

#### Focus Highlighting
The ability to highlight the players current focus in any form.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't highlight the focus
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting the focus
  - custom border color
  - custom scale
  - custom texture

After:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Midnight Nameplate Options use minimal highlighting of the focus target
  - focusing a target puts a tiny golden border around it
  - thats it
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting the focus
  - custom border color
  - custom scale
  - custom texture

  </figure>
</div>

##### Verdict & Suggestion

What can I say. It's better than what the Retail Nameplates currently offer. But it's a massive downgrade to addons.

Please consider:
- allowing customizing the focus border color for accessibility reasons alone already
- consider allowing to customize the focus nameplate texture
- consider allowing to customize the focus nameplate scale

#### Texture & Font Replacing

### Auras

#### Pandemic Glow of Tracked Auras

#### Aura - Generic Tracking
The ability to track auras, primarily of the player and their pets on nameplates.

Before:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Retail Default Nameplates just tracks all your auras
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows filtering via allow and deny lists
  - the default lists are not perfectly maintained, but profiles can fill the gap

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options use the same list of auras to track as Retail
  - which means it also comes with the same bugs
  - no option to allow/denylist anything by name or id
- ‚ùìPlater _may_ be able to display the very same auras as the default nameplates. At the time of writing, this isn't 100% confirmed however.

##### Verdict
Better than nothing, but needs upfront fixing and then continuous work.

Bombardments?

#### Aura - Reordering
The ability to reorder auras, e.g. by duration at application time. Useful for consistency, especially for dot specs, think of "my out-of-the-box longest lasting dot can always be found at the first position" cases.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates reorder based on a set ordering logic
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows reordering

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options don't allow reordering
  - the ordering logic [is unchanged to what you already currently see on Live](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source/blob/live/Interface/AddOns/Blizzard_NamePlates/Blizzard_NamePlates.lua#L699-L705) when using the default nameplates:
    - first, show auras that originate from the player
    - then, show auras that you can apply (e.g. trinket procs aren't player spells so they have less priority)
    - for all remaining auras, use order of application, ignoring stacks, expiration time/remaining duration, etc. - this includes your pets
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to either

##### Verdict
Not a core feature, but nice to have for consistency.

#### Aura - Filtering
The ability to filter auras by name or id.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates filter via inaccessible flags only
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows filtering via allow and deny lists
  - again, the default lists are not perfectly maintained, but profiles can fill the gap

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options don't allow filtering
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to either

##### Verdict
If meticulously and continuously maintained by Blizzard, probably ok, otherwise anything from endurably to dramatically worse. With the pruning, there'll be less auras to track, but some specs and abilities will still apply a literally confusing amount of debuffs, e.g. <Deathmark />.

#### Aura - Special
The ability to highlight a specific set of auras in some form, usually isolated from the other auras.

For context, this refers to the `Buff Special` functionality in Plater and what the Midnight Nameplate Options refer to as `Shared CCs` due to both being positioned in the same place.

<center>
  <img src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/buff-special.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
</center>

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't differentiate between auras
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting special auras
  - requires manual maintenance by spell id
  - the default list is not well maintained, but profiles can fill the gap

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options include an option to show `Shared CCs`
  - the default list is not well maintained, we cannot fill the gap
  - there's false positives but also a lot missing
    - for example, the <Landslide /> root isn't tracked but <TerrorOfTheSkies /> is tracked
    - for example, the <FireBreath /> dot is incorrectly tracked as `Shared CC` for both <DevastationEvoker abbreviated /> and <AugmentationEvoker abbreviated />
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater likely will be able to separate display these

##### Verdict
Better than nothing, but needs work. Currently a clear downgrade. Also unclear whether it'll track e.g. damage amp debuffs such as <WowheadLink id={1245292} icon="spell_shadow_blackplague" kind="spell">Destabilized</WowheadLink> on Dimensius Phase 3. Without that, it's only a shadow of what Plater allows.

#### Aura - Friendly Buffs
The ability to highlight your own beneficial auras on friendly nameplates.

<center>
  <img src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/friendly-aura-settings.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
</center>

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Friendly Nameplates don't highlight friendly auras
- ‚ùå Plater couldn't do so either as friendly nameplates are locked down

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options include highlighting friendly auras
- ‚ùì unknown at this time whether Plater can and will do this

<center>
  <img src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/temporary-friendly-buff-1.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" />
</center>

##### Verdict & Suggestion

This was a surprising, but welcome. Not because I'm particularily fond of this feature, but more features, especially for friendly nameplates which haven't been touched since WoD, are always welcome.

Unforunately it currently doesn't seem to be very strict in terms of what is a "temporary" buff and will happily show _any_ buff you applied to the target, including raid buffs and other long lasting buffs such as <BlisteringScales /> (60+ mins) or <Timelessness /> (30+ mins) as well as <WowheadLink id={390386} kind="spell" icon="ability_evoker_furyoftheaspects">Fury of the Aspects</WowheadLink> (annoying since it would show on everyone).

It's limited to two auras based on application time. No reordering occurs if you'd apply a third, shorter-lived aura which I'd assume is ok as long as longer-lived buffs like those above are actually filtered out.

#### Aura - Invalidate Unit

### Color Changes

#### Nameplate Color Change
The ability to change the color of a nameplate procedurally for any reason, e.g. based on NPC id, aura presence or threat.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't ever change color
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows changing the nameplate color
  - allows setting new defaults
  - allows setting a color based on threat situation
  - allows setting a color per NPC id
  - through scripts, allows setting color based on aura presence

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options don't allow changing the nameplate color
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater will continue to be able to change the color by setting new defaults for _all_ nameplates and their threat situation
  - but will lose the ability to _conditionally_ change the color based on aura presence or NPC id

##### Verdict
üëé significantly worse than before and an instantly visible downgrade.

Going on a limb here claiming that everyone who has used this feature for a while knows that it is simply too much of an advantage to do nothing. That's not to say that it should get removed without replacement.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is also an accessibility issue. The default colorblind modes don't actually _really_ seem to help most colorblind users, customizability beats generic colorblind modes by miles.

<img src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/colorblindness.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"/>

##### Suggestion

Blizzard already has implicit classifications of NPCs:
- bosses
  - as indicated internally via `boss1`, `boss2`, `bossN`, ... units
- cc-immune NPCs that are not bosses
  - lieutenants such as the minibosses in Priory but also the <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={206696}>Knights</WowheadLink> in Priory
- casters, as indicated by their mana bar
  - your classic <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={206697}>Priest</WowheadLink> casting Smite and <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={221760}>Mage</WowheadLink> casting Fireball in Priory
- everything else, usually minions, melees, pets, rogues
  - everything from <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={206699}>jumping cats</WowheadLink> to <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={206694}>sharpshooters</WowheadLink> and <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={206705}>footmen</WowheadLink> in Priory

There can of course be overlaps, e.g. <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={212831}>Forge Master Damian</WowheadLink> (right side forge lieutenant) in Priory having - but not using -  mana or <WowheadLink kind="npc" id={211289}>Taener Duelmal</WowheadLink> (mage lieutenant) in Priory being a mage but neither having nor using mana.

Blizzard even has existing code that uses the low-level classification of "caster" vs "non-caster": the <WowheadClassIcon>Warlock</WowheadClassIcon> Venthyr covenant ability <WowheadLink id={321792} icon="ability_revendreth_warlock" kind="spell">Impending Catastrophe</WowheadLink> (which is also dearly missed by some <WowheadClassIcon>Warlock</WowheadClassIcon>s) auto-cursed targets hit with either <WowheadLink icon="spell_shadow_curseofmannoroth" id={702}>Curse of Weakness</WowheadLink> (non-casters) or <WowheadLink id={1714} icon="spell_shadow_curseoftounges">Curse of Tongues</WowheadLink> (casters).

You might already see where I'm going with this:

Add these categories (`boss` | `notable enemy` | `caster` | `non-caster`) to the default UI nameplate settings and allow setting a custom color for them, then integrate it into the Midnight nameplates.

We'd still be unable to define more colors than that, but it would alleviate most of the pain of this feature disappearing. It'd also significantly help people to learn a dungeon and also fix aforementioned accessibility problems. We have this very option with the item rarity color settings!

#### Threat Color Change
The ability to visibily indicate a threat situation change on a nameplate. Role-aware and ideally also pet-aware, as there's not only regular pets that may taunt, but also e.g. temporary guardians such as <WowheadLink icon="spell_nature_earthelemental_totem" kind="spell" id={198103}>Earth Elemental</WowheadLink>.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't ever change color
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows changing the threat color
  - both in general
  - but also situationally through scripts, making a nameplate aware of whether the now-tanking unit is a pet like the aforementioned elemental

After:  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Midnight introduces threat highlighting options
  - neither options allow recoloring the nameplate
  - both options are not very visible in practice
  - the additional texture imo doesn't play well with all nameplate types
- ‚ùå Plater will be both unable to determine who gained/lost threat and change color

##### Verdict
Better than nothing, but needs work. The ability to highlight threat on pets is now gone. It wasn't extremely important, but commonly when such an ability was used it was to help the tank. Now the tank is sweating extra because they think they lost aggro on top of already struggling.

#### Nameplate Scaling
The ability to change the scale of a nameplate procedurally for any reason, e.g. based on NPC id, aura presence or threat.

A criminally underused feature and one of my favorites. The gist: not all mobs are equally relevant to keep track of their health or cast bars in a pull. So why have them all the same size?

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates allow scaling, but never make use of it
- ‚ùì Plater itself only allows scaling all nameplates
  - once again, scripts to the rescue

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options largely only allows scaling all nameplates in 5 predefined steps
  - notably, there's an option to scale less relevant nameplates down based on the kind of unit, separating between Minions, "Minor" and Friendly Players/NPCs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater will continue to be able to change the scaling by setting new defaults for _all_ nameplates AND inherit the scaling of the a particular NPC if the game considers it relevant
  - no dynamic scaling based on NPC id
  - no dynamic scaling based on e.g. auras on the player such as fixates

##### Verdict
üëé worse than before and an instantly visible downgrade. Not an insurmountable loss like nameplate colors, but still noticeable, particularily during pre-patch. Ultimately, it won't be too painful because with a new dungeon rotation, you have no before/after effect so the transition won't be too jarring.

##### Suggestion
Similar to the [Nameplate Color Change Suggestion](#nameplate-color-change), add another category for `Notable Enemies` such as lieutenants and cc immune NPCs and allow optionally increasing their scale in relation to the selected general scale. Basically inverse `Simplify Nameplates` and give both better labels. With that, I'd consider this adopted despite not even remotely fully solve what the Plater mod [Priority Based Scaling](https://wago.io/Ru_9FLVjI) and our improved fork are capable of solving, but at least acknowledges the importance of, well, important NPCs.

Icing on the cake would be role-specific scaling. Sparingly used in our mod, but still:
- tanks care less about enemies without abilities and more about enemies with tankbusters
- melees care more about enemies with frontals such as <WowheadLink id={213934} kind="npc">Tacticians</WowheadLink> or area-denial from <WowheadLink id={231014} kind="npc">Loaderbots</WowheadLink>
- casters care little about what melees often care about (a tale as old as time)

### Distance-Based Scaling
The ability to scale nameplates based on distance of the nameplate unit to the player.

This is an entirely new feature for 12.0 but it's both undocumented and uncontrollable at this time.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates allow scaling, but never make use of it
- ‚ùå Plater cannot do that as arbitrary range detection isn't possible

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplates do this by default
- ‚ùì Plater cannot reproduce this

##### Verdict & Suggestion

Probably not even a terrible idea, but needs an option to toggle and probably also options at which distance they reach maximum scale.

There _seem_ to be CVars for it:
- `nameplateMaxScaleDistance`, default 10
- `nameplateMinScaleDistance`, default 10
- `nameplateMinScale`, default 0.8

...but they don't seem to do anything currently. Note that `nameplateMinScale` isn't necessarily for this and may also refer to the scale of enemies considered `Minor` or `Minions`.

What's particularily wild is that the CVar descriptions suggest the distance is measured based on the _camera_ distance, not the player. You're reading this right, the nameplate renders more information if your actual camera is closer to the unit.

This is at maximum distance at which the nameplate appears:

<center className="flex gap-2 justify-center flex-col xl:flex-row">
  <img className="h-auto xl:h-120 object-contain mt-0 mb-0" src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/distance-scaling-1.jpg" alt="player at maximum distance to a unit, indicating its considerably far" loading="lazy" />

</center>

Standing right next to the unit at a reasonable camera distance:

<center className="flex gap-2 justify-center flex-col xl:flex-row">
  <img className="h-auto xl:h-120 object-contain mt-0 mb-0" src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/distance-scaling-2.jpg" alt="player standing right next to a unit, highlighting the differences of information on the nameplate due to being closer" loading="lazy" />

</center>

Now zooming in to have the camera even closer:

### Cast Bar
#### Cast Bar - Target Name
The ability to show the name of the target of a casting unit.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates cannot show the target name
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows showing the target name

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options include an option to show the target name
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater will likely be able to show the target name

##### Verdict & Suggestion
Generally speaking, works. Colors the target name by class color automatically. Does however not remove the realm name from the target if the unit is on another realm, leading to questionable behaviour:

</center>

Apparently it also just doesn't work reliably - the target was myself and it worked fine with the next cast.

#### Cast Bar - Cast Name
The ability to show the name of a spell being cast.

Before:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Retail Default Nameplates shows the cast name
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows showing the cast name

After:
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options include an option to show the cast name
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater will likely be able to show the spell name

##### Verdict
Works! Optionally allows showing the spell icon too, which is basically identical to what the Retail Default Nameplates do (although they don't seem to show the icon on channels).

Minor nuisance: hiding the spell icon doesn't adjust the position of the cast name despite more space being available now. Makes it look misaligned.

#### Cast Bar - Remaining Time
The ability to show the remaining time until a cast finishes.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates cannot show the remaining time
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows showing the remaining time

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options include an option to show the remaining time
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to show the remaining time either

##### Verdict

Mixed bag. It's not extremely important to know how long a cast will take once you're past the learning stage. But it helps to get a good feeling for an important spell by knowing its cast time early on and it's not like that info is gone, you just have to look at logs now instead. 

I'm also intentionally ignoring the edge case of "can I finish my cast before this spell goes off". Sure, before you were able to see it _easier_ but in close cases you'd still rather not risk it anyway.

#### Cast Bar - Interrupt Source
The ability to show the name of the unit interrupting a cast.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates cannot show the interrupt source
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows showing the interrupt source

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options include no option to show the interrupt source
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to show the interrupt source either

##### Verdict

Probably ok not to have this info, personally never felt it to be extremely relevant in a world where interrupt tracking is readily available anyway and it didn't compete with that either. And in a world where you can't track neither, you'd rather have static interrupt tracking over this.

#### Cast Bar - Dynamic Color
The ability to dynamically change the color of the cast bar. Primarily used to indicate whether a spell is interruptible and whether the player can interrupt.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't ever change their color
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows changing the color of the cast bar
  - the default customization is just that, blanket change the color
  - mods can go further

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options don't allow changing the color of the cast bar
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to change the color of the cast bar as unit casting info and cooldown info are secrets

##### Implementation
Some context here is needed, as its one of the more complex mods we supported. The Plater mod `Enemy Enhanced Castbar` which was published some time during Dragonflight and later [was forked by us](https://github.com/ljosberinn/xeph-ui/blob/master/plater/enhanced-enemy-cast-bar/init.lua) keeps track of your interrupt ability and colored cast bars based on its availability:
- if your interrupt is on cooldown and won't be ready during its cast time, the cast bar will be <span style={{ color: 'orange'}}>orange</span>
- if your interrupt is on cooldown but will be ready during its cast time, the cast bar will be <span style={{ color: 'yellow'}}>yellow</span>
  - and show a marker in the cast bar for when your interrupt is ready
  - and change to <span style={{ color: 'green'}}>green</span> once you're past that marker
- and finally of course, if your interrupt is ready, the cast bar will be <span style={{ color: 'green'}}>green</span>

  <img src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/enhanced-enemy-castbar.png" alt="a description of the capabilities of the Enhanced Enemy Castbar mod including various cast bar states for illustrative purposes" loading="lazy" />
</center>

##### Verdict
üëé worse than before and an instantly visible downgrade. Note that I didn't use this mod myself, but [instead used a WeakAura tracking focus cast](https://wago.io/Ha6BllGze) instead and implemented the same "can interrupt past this point" logic there which I'll dearly miss.

Yes, this is absolutely one of the features that provide an advantage against those that don't have it.

It's also one of the most popular features based on feedback from users. And interrupts will go away. Even with the upcoming  longer lockouts from interrupts in Midnight, as much as I can understand that this mod has to go away in its current form, interrupts will stay. Adopting this as baseline feature would be a huge boon.

#### Cast Bar - Spell Reflect Indicator
The ability to indicate whether a spell being cast on you can be <SpellReflection>Spell Reflected</SpellReflection>.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't care about <SpellReflection />
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater itself doesn't care about <SpellReflection />
  - mods can fill the gap

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options include no feature for <SpellReflection />
- ‚ùå Plater won't be able to fill the gap anymore as unit casting info is secret

##### Implementation
Again context here is needed. If an enemy is seen casting a spell on you, besides doing its regular interrupt checks, the mod will  check whether the spell is in a hand-maintained list (thank you again, Sense) of known reflectable spells and then lookup your <SpellReflection /> state. If available, it'll color the cast bar in a unique color for <SpellReflection /> specifically.

</center>

##### Verdict

In an ideal world, tooling surrounding <SpellReflection /> isn't necessary. We're in no such world however, so a <WowheadClassIcon>Warrior</WowheadClassIcon> now has only two options:
- go through try and error themselves, potentially wasting a defensive, until you learned which spells can be reflected and which can't, when to use what, and so on. Historically an inconsistent mess.
- wait a moment and hope Sense updates his spell reflection sheet for this patch and learn that

Wait, wasn't there a note for <SpellBlock /> recently...

> Developers' notes: <SpellBlock /> required a lot of specialized knowledge to use. Not only did you need to know when damage was coming, but also whether it was a form of magic damage that could be blocked or not and thus affected by the ability. AOE damage isn't blockable, neither is periodic damage. Some tankbusters are and others aren't. We weren't happy with the knowledge demanded to use the ability effectively.

I'm obviously not advocating for the removal of <SpellReflection /> but please, before you put out statements like the above, use some reflection yourself. A lot of other abilities need "a lot of specialized knowledge" - just to name a few:
- <Zephyr />
  - <WowheadLink id={1241694} kind="spell" icon="spell_shadow_carrionswarm">not everything that looks like AoE is actually AoE</WowheadLink> 
  - <WowheadLink id={353312} kind="spell" icon="ability_paladin_artofwar">some things are AoE despite not looking like it</WowheadLink>
- <AntiMagicShell /> - deflect vs. absorb
- <AntiMagicZone /> -  <WowheadLink id={438879} kind="spell" icon="inv_minespider2_cave">some abilities seem to be magical, but aren't</WowheadLink>
- <SpellReflection /> - reflect / deflect / just damage reduction

That's not an inherently bad thing. But if things aren't communicated clearly by the game - something that's promised to improve with Midnight and people like me will very closely watch - then people will reach to tooling like this, which will be sorely missed. 

#### Cast Bar - Highlighting Important Casts
The ability to put some kind of emphasis on a set of casts, either by spell id or name, that are deemed important for any reason.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't differentiate any casts
- ‚úîÔ∏è Plater allows highlighting important casts
  - requires manual maintenance by spell id
  - the default tooling provided for this, once again, is hardly maintained but profiles can fill the gap

After:  
- ‚úîÔ∏è Midnight Nameplate Options allow highlighting important casts
  - the highlighting is visually minimal
  - no surrounding options to choose from (e.g. texture, flashing). you either like the setting or you don't
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Plater will continue to be able to highlight casts the default nameplates consider important
  - no custom set of spell ids to maintain
  - whether a custom animation will be possible is currently unknown

##### Verdict
If properly maintained by Blizzard, probably ok. Unfortunately there's no dungeon journal entries for Trash so we can only go by what's marked as Important for raid, where a tool like this has significantly less relevance. Definitely needs work on the UI front however.

#### Cast Bar - Highlighting of Fixates
The ability to highlight a nameplate of a unit fixating the player in any way.

This was also nicely pairable with nameplate scaling. Note the spawning mine being scaled to a much smaller size until it starts fixating me, where it'll get upscaled instead:

<center>
    <video src="/static/images/nameplates-midnight/fixate-scaling.mp4" type="video/mp4" controls muted loop autoPlay />
</center>

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't highlight fixates
- ‚ùì Plater itself ships a script with fixates
  - it's not well maintained but profiles can fill the gap

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options have no such option
- ‚ùå Plater will no longer be able to determine whether a unit targets anyone specifically

##### Verdict
Could be situationally ok if it was properly telegraphed but looking at these recent examples, it commonly isn't: 
- ‚ùå Operation: Floodgate has <WowheadLink id={231014} kind="npc">Loaderbots</WowheadLink> spinning and the only indication is them targeting you with their channel
- ‚ùå on One-Armed Bandit, bombs had a yellow line connecting to the player, technically obvious but meshed badly with the encounter room floor
- ‚úîÔ∏è The MOTHERLODE!! had fixating bombs which had a red line connecting to the player, considerably obvious
- ‚ùå Broodtwister Ovi'nax had fixates as a core mechanic of the encounter with no indication beyond a debuff

Here's to hoping that visibility for this mechanic gets improved in the future, then this niche feature is obsolete.

### Misc
#### Name Shortening / Renaming Units
The ability to manipulate NPC names.

Before:
- ‚ùå Retail Default Nameplates don't have any options to shorten names
- ‚ùì Plater allows renaming NPCs by id individually
  - very tedious process when done manually
  - allows setting the name of an NPC to any arbitrary nickname
  - scripts can fill the gap

After:
- ‚ùå Midnight Nameplate Options don't allow renaming NPCs
  - unit names are secrets

##### Implementation
Some context needed here once again. Any time there's a bunch of enemies in a section of a dungeon, they _often_ but not always share the same adjectives before the actual type of NPC. For example, you'll encounter a lot of <WowheadLink id={234872} kind="npc">Wastelander Phaseblades</WowheadLink> and <WowheadLink id={234957} kind="npc">Wastelander Ritualists</WowheadLink> (and a bunch more) in the arena of the second boss of Eco-Dome Al'dani. Now nameplates have only a certain length, so in many cases, they get truncated and you end up just reading `Wastelande...` or whatever your nameplate width setting allows. **This will be the default behavior for Midnight nameplates.**

Terrible for communication in various ways:
- planning: "I'm kicking the left Ritualist!"
  - need to either know already or figure out which of the enemies is the Ritualist, which may already be on the move and collapse with another caster
- spontaneous adjustments: "I failed my kick, we need a stop on the far caster/Ritualist!"
  - need to either be aware of mob positioning at all times
  - or have pulled a low amount of casters in order to have a uniquely identifyable caster in the pull at a given time
    - which is absolutely not possible in that dungeon which is meant to be a testimony of new dungeon design
  - in many cases, cast times are not forgiving enough to allow these mistakes and still manage to cover for them

So what the mod does is - for the most part - to only ever render the last word in the name of an enemy: `Phaseblade` or `Ritualist`.

##### Verdict
üëé significantly worse than before and an instantly visible downgrade. Just to name a few examples:

- Operation: Floodgate
  - <WowheadLink id={229686} kind="npc">Venture Co. Surveyor</WowheadLink> and <WowheadLink id={229250} kind="npc">Venture Co. Contractor</WowheadLink>
  - <WowheadLink id={229212} kind="npc">Darkfuse Demolitionist</WowheadLink>, <WowheadLink id={228144} kind="npc">Darkfuse Soldier</WowheadLink> and <WowheadLink id={231385} kind="npc">Darkfuse Inspector</WowheadLink>, possibly with a <WowheadLink id={230748} kind="npc">Darkfuse Bloodwarper</WowheadLink> too
- Eco-Dome Al'dani
    - as extreme example, in the arena of the second boss, there's:
      - 13x <WowheadLink id={234872} kind="npc">Wastelander Phaseblades</WowheadLink>
      - 11x <WowheadLink id={234962} kind="npc">Wastelander Farstalkers</WowheadLink>
      - 5x <WowheadLink id={234960} kind="npc">Tamed Ruinstalker</WowheadLink>
      - 4x <WowheadLink id={234957} kind="npc">Wastelander Ritualists</WowheadLink>
      - 1x <WowheadLink id={242631} kind="npc">Overcharged Sentinel</WowheadLink>
      - 34 enemies, 28 start with an informationally useless adjective: `Wastelander`

You may recognize the bottom right corner of this screenshot from the Cast Bar - Target Name section. Pay attention to the NPC names this time. There's nine nameplates visible, **all** of them are for enemies starting with `Vilebranch`.

##### Suggestion
There's an inherent problem making this work across localizations generically so in my opinion, the best way to fix this going forward is to be more mindful of NPC naming in relation to other NPCs. It'll be the most natural way of the need for this tool to go away.

The other obvious solution to this would be nameplate colors but we've talked about that already.

## Console Variables

## Maintenance

- put emphasis on when/how often we look into changes
- put emphasis on bug reports and feedback from users on reddit, discord, guild, dms
- put emphasis on that we sometimes still miss things!

## Potential Upsides

Not all is doom and gloom. I have to admit, it does look dire, but I'm also trusting that Blizzard has reasonable motivation to not alienate the userbase _too_ much. Expansion launches have historically been the largest surges of players and I find it hard to believe that Blizzard would risk bombing that.

And maybe I'm trusting a bit too much here but: Blizzard isn't bound to third-party developers and sites for their updates. If they want to fix some spell(s) not showing up on nameplates, the cooldown manager, add a new metric to the damage meter, they can just hotfix that in. 

## Potential Downsides

Just as easy as Blizzard can hotfix stuff, they can also not do that. The cooldown manager was introduced in 11.1 and is at the time of writing, a week after 11.2.5, just _barely_ usable. Of course if the intent for it was to only become relevant with 12.0, then what was the point of releasing it already, especially after communicating that most of the class changes we're currently seeing in the Alpha are only a byproduct of the addon restrictions from recent months?

I was in middle school when Patch 1.11 released in 2006. Servers were on fire for days, from what I recall due to the Scourge invasion events. It was the time of "never play on patch day". What is preventing a lack of upfront maintenance on the cooldown manager and nameplates from becoming the new "never play on patch day" whenever a spec gets reworked or the new tier set introduces a new aura that is relevant to track? There's spells I've reported on the Liberation of Undermine PTR _over half a year ago_ (<Bombardments />, <MassEruption />) that _still_ are either not available for tracking or bugged in the cooldown manager in 12.0.

The community needs Blizzard to step up massively here. Replacing addons, and especially addons with as many customization features as this, with barebones replacements _can_ work, but only with a promise of rapid iteration - and we've not seen any of that.
